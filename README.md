A smol script that helps with previewing animations in the inspector inside an animator controller!

Usually if you click an animation state in the animator controller, the inspector only shows settings for the selected state, but not the animation itself.

This simply adds an animation preview to the inspector, that way you don't have to switch off from the controller to view the animations.

It inherits from ObjectPreview, and the methods are all found in the Unity docs! https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/ObjectPreview.html
